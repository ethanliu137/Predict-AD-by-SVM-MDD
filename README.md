# Thesis Review  

#### Thesis Topic  
**Predicting the Treatment Outcomes of Antidepressants using a Deep Neural Network of Deep Learning in Drug-Naïve Major Depressive Patients**  

---

## Introduction
- For future applications of **machine learning in the medical field**, we chose this paper as the subject of our study.  
- The main focus is on predicting antidepressant treatment outcomes in **drug-naïve major depressive patients**.  

---

## Method
- Selected **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for training and testing.  
- Applied **feature engineering** to improve accuracy and enhance model performance.  

---

## Result
- **Accuracy Score:** `0.8214 ± 0.1185`  

---

## Future Work
- Compare with other models (e.g., Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks).  
- Expand dataset for more robust validation.
